## Project Ideas
* Modelling Distributed Systems (which services? which APIs? Bounded contexts)
* Simple comparative project REST/graphql/protobuf
* Advance social network example
* Research how a large distributed architecture is organized (fabebook, uber, netflix etc)
* Make resiliency lab more engaging using observability platforms
* Read a recent research paper on a relate topic a make a presentation
