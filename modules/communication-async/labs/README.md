# Labs

## Lab 1: Basic RabbiMQ Communication

1. Implement a **provider-service** sending an *Event* to a message broker (*queue.messages* exchange) each second and logging its activity.
2. Implement a **consumer-service** connecting to the same message broker (*queue.messages* exchange) and logging the received events.

```java
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Data
public class Event<K, T> {
    public enum Type {CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE}

    @NonNull private Type type;
    @NonNull private K key;
    @NonNull private T data;
    private LocalDateTime timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
}
```

## Lab 2: Scaling services with Asynchronous Communication

In this lab, you'll implement an asynchronous system for computing prime numbers based of three microservices:
- **proxy-service**: Exposes an endpoint to receive HTTP requests.
- **math-service**: Computes prime numbers (deploy three instances).
- **notification-service**: Receives the prime numbers computed by an instance of **math-service** and logs them.

1. Implement a **proxy-service** for consuming **math-service**:
   * `POST /primes {lowerbound, upperbound, email}` â†’ communicates asynchronously with multiple instances of **math-service**.

2. Implement a **math-service**:
- Listens for incoming asynchronous events.
- Computes the requested prime numbers.
- Send a notification event to the **notification-service**.

2. Implement a **notification-service**:
- Listens for incoming **asynchronous events**.
- Logs the computed results.
