### Key Concepts of GitHub Actions

- **Workflow**: A YAML file that defines a set of jobs to be executed when specific events occur (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
- **Job**: A collection of steps that run on a specified virtual environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
- **Step**: An individual task within a job, such as running a script or executing an action.
- **Actions**: Predefined or custom reusable commands.
- **Secrets**: Encrypted variables used to secure sensitive information (e.g., API keys).

### Running Jobs in GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, jobs are the primary unit of work in a workflow. Jobs can be executed either **in parallel** or **sequentially** depending on the configuration in the YAML file.

#### Parallel Execution of Jobs

By default, jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow run **in parallel**, meaning they will start at the same time and run concurrently, provided they do not have dependencies on each other.

This is useful for tasks that are independent of each other, allowing you to speed up your CI/CD pipeline by running jobs simultaneously.

**Example** (Parallel Execution):
```yaml
name: Parallel Jobs Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 1"

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 2"

  job3:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 3"
```
In the example above, `job1`, `job2`, and `job3` will run in parallel because they do not have any dependencies defined between them.

#### Sequential Execution of Jobs

To run jobs sequentially, meaning one job starts only after the completion of another, you can use the `needs` keyword. This allows you to define a dependency between jobs, where a job will only execute after another job successfully finishes.

**Example** (Sequential Execution):
```yaml
name: Sequential Jobs Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 1"
  
  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1  # job2 will start after job1 finishes
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 2"
  
  job3:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job2  # job3 will start after job2 finishes
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 3"
```
In this case:
- `job1` runs first.
- `job2` starts only after `job1` completes successfully.
- `job3` starts only after `job2` completes successfully.

#### Combining Parallel and Sequential Jobs

You can also combine parallel and sequential jobs in a single workflow. Some jobs may need to run sequentially (due to dependencies), while others can run in parallel.

**Example** (Parallel and Sequential Combination):
```yaml
name: Mixed Jobs Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 1"
  
  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1  # Runs after job1
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 2"

  job3:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 3"
  
  job4:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [job2, job3]  # Runs after both job2 and job3
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 4"
```
In this case:
- `job1` runs first.
- `job3` runs in parallel with `job1`.
- `job2` starts after `job1` completes.
- `job4` runs only after both `job2` and `job3` finish.

## Continuous Delivery Workflow

The following configuration file defines a CI/CD pipeline for a Java project. It includes steps for linting, security scanning, building, and deploying a Docker image. Here's how to assemble it step by step.

### Define Workflow Metadata

Create a file under the repository path *repo_root/.github/workflows/workflow.yml*. Each file in this directory defines a separate workflow, and workflows are triggered and executed independently in parallel when their respective events occur.

Start with the workflow's name and triggers:

```yaml
name: CI-CD Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Trigger on pushes to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Trigger on pull requests targeting the main branch
```

- **`name`**: Descriptive title for the workflow.
- **`on`**: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow (`push`, `pull_request`).


### Add Jobs Section

Jobs define the tasks to execute. Each job runs independently unless dependencies are specified. In this example, we define:

1. **Lint Scan**: Checks code quality using Super-Linter.
2. **Build Artifact**: Builds a Java artifact using Maven.
3. **Build and Push Docker Image**: Builds and pushes a Docker image.

### Define the `lint-scan` Job

**Super Linter** is a powerful GitHub Action that helps automate the process of linting code in various programming languages. It is designed to detect syntax and style issues in your code, ensuring that it adheres to best practices and code standards. The Super Linter action supports a wide range of languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Go, and more, making it an excellent choice for multi-language projects.

- **Multi-Language Support**: Super Linter supports dozens of programming languages, helping developers ensure consistent code quality across various files.
- **Customizable**: You can configure Super Linter to use specific linters for different languages, providing flexibility to match your projectâ€™s needs.
- **GitHub Integration**: It seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions, enabling automatic linting as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Easy Setup**: With just a few lines in your GitHub Actions workflow file, you can set up Super Linter and start linting your code.

```yaml
  # Lint Scan Job
  lint-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    permissions:
      contents: read # Required to access repository contents
      packages: read # Required to read packages
      statuses: write # Allow reporting GitHub status checks

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch full history for accurate file change tracking

      - name: Run Super-Linter
        uses: super-linter/super-linter@v7.3.0
        env:
          VALIDATE_JAVA: true # Enables checks for Java and disables all others
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} # Authentication token
```

- **`runs-on`**: Specifies the virtual environment (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **Steps**:
    - **Checkout code**: Fetches the repository contents.
    - **Run Super-Linter**: Validates Java files using a linter.


### Add the `build-artifact` Job

```yaml
  # Build Artifact Job
  build-artifact:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        java-version: [21, 22] # Test against Java 21, 22

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Java Environment
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: ${{ matrix.java-version }} # Use the version from the matrix
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: maven # Enable Maven dependency caching

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots verify

      - name: Copy Build Artifact
        run: mkdir staging && cp target/*.jar staging

      - name: Upload Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: jar-artifact-java-${{ matrix.java-version }} # Make the artifact name include the Java version
          path: staging
```

This job builds the project and saves the JAR artifact.


### Add the `build-push-container-image` Job

```yaml
  # Build and Push Docker Image Job
  build-push-container-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-artifact # Depend on the artifact build job

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download Build Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: jar-artifact-java-21
          path: target/

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t nbicocchi/product-service-ci-cd:latest .

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} # Docker Hub username
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }} # Docker Hub password

      - name: Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
        run: docker push nbicocchi/product-service-ci-cd:latest
```

This job builds a Docker image, scans it for vulnerabilities using Trivy, and pushes it to Docker Hub.
