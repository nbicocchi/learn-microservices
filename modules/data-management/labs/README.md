## Lab 1: Orchestration-based Saga

In this exercise, three services collaborate to implement a **Saga Pattern** using Orkes Conductor. The services are:

1. **Order Service**: Accepts a POST request to create an order (`POST /order`), and starts the workflow.
2. **Payment Service**: Validates and processes the customer’s payment.
3. **Inventory Service**: Checks product availability and reserves the items in the warehouse.

  OrkesConductor -->|Confirm Order| OrderService
  OrkesConductor -->|Reject Order| OrderService
  OrkesConductor -->|Check Payment| PaymentService
  PaymentService -->|Payment Success| OrkesConductor
  PaymentService -->|Payment Failed| OrkesConductor
  OrkesConductor -->|Check Inventory| InventoryService
  InventoryService -->|Inventory Success| OrkesConductor
  InventoryService -->|Inventory Failed| OrkesConductor
  
```

## Lab 2: Choreography-based Saga

In this exercise, three services collaborate to implement a **Saga Pattern** using asynchronous messaging. The services are:

1. **Order Service**: Accepts a POST request to create an order (`POST /order`), and starts the workflow.
2. **Payment Service**: Validates and processes the customer’s payment.
3. **Inventory Service**: Checks product availability and reserves the items in the warehouse.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Client -->|POST /order| OrderService
  OrderService -->|order.created| PaymentService
  PaymentService -->|payment.ok| InventoryService
  PaymentService -->|payment.failed| OrderService
  InventoryService -->|inventory.ok| OrderService
  InventoryService -->|inventory.failed| OrderService
```

## Lab 3: CQRS

In this exercise, three services collaborate to implement a **Saga Pattern** using asynchronous messaging. The services are:

1. **Order Service**: Accepts a POST request to create an order (`POST /order`), and starts the workflow.
2. **Payment Service**: Validates and processes the customer’s payment.
3. **Inventory Service**: Checks product availability and reserves the items in the warehouse.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Client-Write -->|POST /order| OrderService-Write
  Client-Read -->|GET /order| OrderService-Read
  OrderService-Write -->|order.created| PaymentService
  OrderService-Write -->|order.confirmed| OrderService-Read
  PaymentService -->|payment.ok| InventoryService
  PaymentService -->|payment.failed| OrderService-Write
  InventoryService -->|inventory.ok| OrderService-Write
  InventoryService -->|inventory.failed| OrderService-Write
```
